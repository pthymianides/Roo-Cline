# Implementation Plan for Auto-Learning and Self-Coding

This document outlines the plan to add auto-learning and self-coding capabilities to the Cline extension.

## Missing Components

1.  **Auto-learning:**
    *   Feedback mechanism to track success/failure of actions.
    *   Error analysis to identify patterns.
    *   Knowledge storage using `mcp-knowledge-graph`.
    *   Learning algorithm (reinforcement learning).
2.  **Self-coding:**
    *   Code generation using an LLM.
    *   Tool creation with schema definition and MCP registration.
    *   Testing for generated code and created tools.
    *   Integration of new code and tools into the codebase.

## Implementation Steps

1.  [x] Implement feedback mechanism in `Cline` class.

3.  [ ] Implement a basic reinforcement learning algorithm.
4.  [ ] Integrate an LLM for code generation.
5.  [ ] Implement the ability to create new tools.
6.  [ ] Implement testing for generated code and tools.
7.  [ ] Implement integration of new code and tools.
8.  [ ] Refine the learning algorithm.
9.  [ ] Continuously improve the extension's capabilities.
